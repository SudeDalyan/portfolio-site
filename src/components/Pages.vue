        <p>A writer is a person who uses written words in different styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Writers
          produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry,
          plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of
          interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to
          use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society</p>
